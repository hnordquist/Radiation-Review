/*
   Notes on terminology:

   The data cache contains data and key pages read from the database.
   
   The ix cache contains index pages used to track data and key pages which
   have overflowed into the log file.

   'pz' means page zero, which refers to the zero'th page in each data or key
   file.  Page zero contains the head of the delete chain, and the location of
   the logical end of the file.

   'rlb' refers to record lock bits.

   'log' refers to the log, or overflow, file.  During a transaction, all
   modified pages are redirected to the log file rather than being written to
   the database.  When the transaction is ended, the log file holds all the
   changes so that recovery is possible.

   'taf' refers to the TAF file, which is used to indicate which kind of lock
   manager is being used, and to indicate if recovery is needed.

   'dbl' refers to the general lock manager's DataBase Lock file.  This file
   contains an image of the in-memory data structures.
