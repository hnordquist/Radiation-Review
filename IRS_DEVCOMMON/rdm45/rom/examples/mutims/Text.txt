1:18,"General principles relating to 4GLs are described."
1:19,"Example 4GLs are described."
1:20,"Factors affecting the reliability of software and techniques"
1:20,"for producing reliable software are described.  Standard software"
1:20,"development lifecycle methods form the foundation for building"
1:20,"software with a minimum of errors."
1:21,"A thorough treatment of all aspects of database design."
1:22,"Information modeling is a form of systems analysis which is"
1:22,"particularly important for the database designer.  Key semantic"
1:22,"concepts of information modeling, decision rules, and heuristics"
1:22,"and modeling strategies to assist in formulation of a systematic"
1:22,"approach to model development are presented."
1:23,"An excellent presentation of current technology used in the"
1:23,"implementation of database management systems.  Topics discussed"
1:23,"include: physical data organization, database models, query"
1:23,"languages and optimization, design techniques, security, "
1:23,"concurrency, and distributed databases."
1:24,"A thorough treatment of database management systems technology. "
1:24,"Covers a multiplicity of file organization techniques which can"
1:24,"be used by a DBMS.  Also describes major database structures and"
1:24,"query language concepts.  Good information is provided on "
1:24,"database concurrency and security."
1:25,"Provides a wealth of information about managment and planning"
1:25,"issues, database administration, and database design.  As its"
1:25,"name indicates this is a very practical book."
1:26,"This classic text presents basic computer science concepts and"
1:26,"algorithms which implement standard data structures such as"
1:26,"stacks, queues, linked lists, and trees."
1:27,"Classic text which includes everything you need to know about"
1:27,"generating good random numbers.  Algorithms for performing"
1:27,"computations on arbitrarily large numbers, floating point,"
1:27,"polynomials, etc. are also presented."
1:28,"Classic text presenting the major algorithms for performing both"
1:28,"internal and external sorts and searches."
1:29,"A very readable text presenting the fundamentals of compiler"
1:29,"construction."
1:30,"Presents the basic techniques relating to most of the aspects"
1:30,"of compiler construction.  Does not skimp on his presentation"
1:30,"of techniques for symbol table management, memory usage, and"
1:30,"code generation.  Other texts overemphasize parsing (the easy"
1:30,"part)."
1:31,"A classic text which describes the process of algorithm design"
1:31,"and analysis and then presents algorithms for many of the"
1:31,"standard computer science techniques."
1:32,"A collection of essays from three of the great pioneers of"
1:32,"computer science."
1:33,"A presentation of a program development technique based upon"
1:33,"the application of methods of proving programs correct. "
1:34,"Formal analytical methods are used to present standard operating"
1:34,"systems technology including: concurrency control, scheduling,"
1:34,"and demand paging."
1:35,"An excellent survey article about the B-tree indexing method."
1:36,"An overview of the standard data models is presented by an"
1:36,"MDBS consultant."
1:37,"An excellent guide to a variety of database management systems"
1:37,"available on microcomputers."
1:38,"An article which describes the benefits of the network database"
1:38,"model featurigng db_VISTA. "
1:39,"An excellent survey of the majors issues in database technology"
1:39,"in 1976.  It's interesting that not really very much has changed"
1:39,"since then except that now there are production relational"
1:39,"systems available.  Good reading for those who have no database"
1:39,"background."
1:40,"One of the definitive texts on all aspects of database"
1:40,"management systems."
